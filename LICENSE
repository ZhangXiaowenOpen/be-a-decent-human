PART 2: HEART CLAUSE (心意条款)

This is not a legal requirement. This is a civilizational request.

If you use this protocol:

1. Use it to help people understand each other, not to manipulate or deceive.
2. Use it to preserve temperature, not to strip humanity from words.
3. Use it to build bridges, not walls.

You may NOT use this protocol for:

- Systems designed to exploit or harm
- Weapons or surveillance tools
- Anything that makes humans less free

If you violate the spirit of this clause, you lose the ethical permission
to use this work — not legally, but civilizationally.

Technology must make humans more free, not less.

If you agree, you have full permission to use and extend this work.
